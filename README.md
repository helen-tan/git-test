# Git Commands
This is a practice repository for practicing Git commands. <br>
The following are some Git commands.

## Basic Git Commands
* A folder named git-test is created in the local machine.
* To create a new folder:
~~~~
mkdir <NEW_FOLDER_NAME>
~~~~
* The git-test folder is opened in an editor (VS Code), and an index.html file is added.

#### Initializing folder as a Git repository
* In the cmd window, I cd into the git-test folder, and type the following command to initialize the folder as a local Git repository.
~~~~
git init
~~~~

#### Checking Git repository Status
* The following command is typed to check the Git repo's status
~~~~
git status
~~~~

#### Adding Files to the Staging Area
* To add files to the staging area of the Git repo:
~~~~
git add .
~~~~
* The . signifies all files.

#### Commiting to Git Repository
* To commit the current staging area to the local Git repo, with the message "first commit"
~~~~
git commit -m "first commit"
~~~~
#### Checking log of Git commits
* To check the log of the commits to your Git repository
~~~~
git log --oneline
~~~~


#### Checkout a file from the previous/older commit
* If we don't like the current file that we have in our folder/ want to go back to the previous version of the file, we can always check out the file from a previous commit.
~~~~
git checkout <commit identifier/number> <file name>
~~~~

#### Inspect what has been changed
* To check exactly what has been changed to a file. It shows the differences between the original file and the file that now has changes made to it.
~~~
git diff <a specific file or folder>
~~~

## Online Git Repositories
First, an online git repository named git-test is setup on Github (This repository that we are looking at now). <br>
Then we copy the URL of the online repo

#### Linking Local repository to Online Git repository
* This sets the local git repo's remote origin to the online GitHub repo.
~~~~
git remote add origin <URL of online repo>
~~~~

#### Pushing commits to online repo
* This command pushes contents of local git repository, to the origin to the master branch (of the online repo)
* Login credentials may be requested at this point. But if given previously, then there is no need to do it again.
~~~~
git push -u origin master
~~~~
Contents of the local git repo will now be pushed to the server side.

#### Cloning an Online Repository
* This command clones (means copy) an online repo onto the local computer.
* The online repo will be cloned into a local folder, with the same name, git-clone (remember to cd into the local folder where you want the cloned repo to appear).
~~~~
git clone <repository URL>
~~~~

## Branching
A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. 
The purpose of Branching is to enable developers to work in parallel dimensions and develop features separately. Also, working on a feature will require several commits. The master branch is the working code in production. If unfinished work is pushed into the master branch, it might become buggy and unstable. Having a branch will allow developers to work in an isolated environment without affecting the master branch. And once work is complete and the code is ready for production, the branch can be merged back into the master branch.
#### See all branches
* To see a list of all the current branches in the project, type ```git branch```, with no arguments.
* A small star will be placed next to the curernt branch in which you are at.
~~~~
git branch
~~~~
#### Creating a new branch
* This command will create a new branch in the project
* Take note, this only creates the branch. To start adding commits to it, the next step is to switch from your current branch to the new branch (see next point).
~~~~
git branch <branch name>
~~~~
#### Switching between branches
* To go to a branch and start making changes/commits, use this command:
~~~
git checkout <branch name>
~~~

## Merging
Before merging back into the master branch, remember to switch back to the master branch with
~~~~
git checkout master
~~~~
To see the difference between the master branch and your branch, type:
~~~~
git diff master..<branch name>
~~~~
After taking the above steps, you can proceed to merge the changes.
#### Merging back into the master branch
~~~~
git merge --no-ff <branch name>
~~~~
#### Cleaning up - deleting branch
* Once a branch has been merged into the master, we can remove the branch. Only the label for the branch will be removed. Our work and the commits will not be removed.
* But if the branch has not been merged, the below command will output an error.
~~~~
git branch -d <branch name>
~~~~
* If you run git branch again, the branch will be gone

## Create a Pull Request
A Pull request is what anables you to tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. By creating a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.

* To push the updated work to the GitHub repo in the form of a Pull Request, run the following command:
~~~~
git push origin <branch name>
~~~~
* After pushing the request, head back to the online Github repo, where it will show your branch and the push that was created. Then create the pull request.

## Getting changes from an online/remote repository
clone and fetch download remote code from a repository's remote URL to your local computer, merge is used to merge different people's work together with yours, and pull is a combination of fetch and merge.

* To retrieve new work done by other people (```git fetch```) and combine them with your local changes (```git merge```), so that your work can be up-to-date with the recent changes, use git pull. git pull is a convenient shortcut for completing both git fetch and git merge in the same command:
~~~~
git pull origin <branch name>
~~~~
* ```git pull origin master``` will pull changes from the origin remote, master branch and merge them to the local checked-out branch.

## Publishing a site on GitHub pages
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service for publishing a website directly on GitHub from a GitHub repository.
#### Step 1: Create a branch called gh-pages
* Create a special branch which is called ```gh-pages```, with ```git branch gh-pages```, then ```git checkout gh-pages``` to switch the working branch to gh-pages.
* To create the gh-pages branch and go to it directly in the same step, run:
~~~~
git checkout -b gh-pages
~~~~
#### Step 2: Push the changes to to publish the site
* Push the gh-pages branch, and the website will be hosted at <username>.github.io/<reponame> .
~~~~
git push origin gh-pages
~~~~
